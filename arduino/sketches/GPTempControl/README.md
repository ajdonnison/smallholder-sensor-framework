# Programmable Temperature Controller

Originally developed in a hurry with parts out of my parts bin, this
was designed to manage a heater to keep water at the correct temperature
to scald poultry to make plucking easier.

Uses a DS18B20 1-Wire temperature sensor and an Arduino Pro Mini

This was connected to a 20 litre plastic pail with a 2kW heating element.
