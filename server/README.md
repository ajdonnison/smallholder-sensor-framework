# Python XBee monitoring and control

Designed to essentially be the middleware component between the XBee
enabled sensors and controllers and the user interface/database/whatever.

This sits and listens for updates from remote controllers and then
logs status updates to a database.  It can also send configuration
and other information back to devices based on queued requests in
the database.
