# Hardware files for associated hardware

As hardware is designed the Eagle and/or Gerber files will be placed here.

Mostly due to the speed at which these items are developed they are built on prototyping board with the circuit being designed as it happens.  As the circuits become more complex and/or I want to be able to reproduce them without having to scratch my head and think about it they will be properly drafted in Eagle or Fritzing and committed.
