# XBee Power Level Shifter

Based on the [SparkFun level shifter](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11978) this was designed to handle level shifting and voltage control for the XBee.  I see that SparkFun have now introduced [something very similar](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11373), with a far better footprint.

This includes the Eagle board and schematic files.
